                        By Hao
                        <span class="highlight">What is a Semiconductor?</span>
                        Semiconductors are materials with tune-able electrical conductivity. Though unusable in its natural form, processing
                        allows it to become a functional device tuned for specific needs.
                        <span class="highlight">What is Silicon?</span>
                        Silicon is one of the metalloids, which exhibits metal-like characteristics while not being a metal. Being not as good
                        as conductors at conducting electricity and only conducting a small amount of electricity, it is thus classified as a
                        semiconductor.
                        <span class="highlight">What is Doping?</span>
                        The process of mixing silicon (in this case) with other elements and making the element impure is called doping. Since
                        silicon atoms have 4 valence shell electrons, it also bonds with 4 other silicon atoms each, creating a lattice shape.
                        There are two types of impurities in a silicon crystal - N-Type and P-type. In N-Type semiconductors, elements like
                        phosphorus (with 5 valence shell electrons) can be added to create bonds with 4 other silicon atoms, with one extra
                        electron left to move around, which increases the silicon's overall conductivity significantly, with the charge carriers
                        being the electrons. In P-Type semiconductors, electrons with less than 3 valence shell electrons, such as boron is
                        added to the silicon, it will bond with only 3 other silicon atoms, resulting in a "hole" between them, which will want
                        to accept electrons into them to create more bonds, with the "holes" being the charge carriers.
                        <span class="highlight">Why is Silicon a Good Fit For Use in Transistors?</span>
                        While chips require electricity to run, it requires the ability to let electricity only "pass" through certain
                        transistors, thus not overloading the chip with instructions. Silicon also is one of the most common elements and
                        operates well at a wide range of temperatures. Its conductivity can be changed by increasing temperature, as well as
                        through doping it with other elements. The P-Type and N-Type silicon can be put together into PNP or NPN transistors.
                        When the start and end terminals are connected to a power source, no electrons flow, but when a separate small current
                        is applied to the middle semiconductor, a large current will flow from one end of the transistor to the other. By
                        applying the current to the middle semiconductor on or off to control when current flows through a semiconductor, logic
                        gates can be created. These logic gates are the building blocks of processing chips.
